# Gaman

**Gaman** is an open source application for training and memorizing **Hiragana** and **Katakana**, focused on visual recognition, repetition, and direct association between Japanese symbols and their corresponding *romaji*.

The project is designed with a clear purpose:  
to provide a simple, focused, and extensible tool for learners who want to **master the Japanese syllabaries** before moving on to grammar and vocabulary. This approach reduces cognitive load and helps learners build a solid foundation before progressing further.  

This project is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**.

## Why the name “Gaman”?

*Gaman* (我慢) is a Japanese concept often described as "quietly bearing the unexpected or bad" that represents **perseverance, discipline, and endurance**, especially in long-term learning processes.

The name reflects the philosophy behind the project:  
**learning Japanese requires consistency, not shortcuts**.

## Project Goal

Gaman is **not** a full Japanese language course and **not** a linguistic analysis tool.  
Its scope is intentionally narrow.

The core goals are:

- Hiragana and Katakana memorization
- Training based on repetition and recall
- Direct symbol → romaji association
- Clear separation between training logic and user interface

The project is built to evolve incrementally while maintaining a clean and maintainable architecture.
